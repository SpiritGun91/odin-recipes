        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add onions and garlic, and cook until onions are
            translucent. Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, and parsley. Simmer
            for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
            minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, and
            remaining parsley.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of
            mozzarella
            cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat
            layers,
            and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray
            foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
