    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds fresh spinach, rinsed and chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until soft and lightly
            browned. Stir in spinach and parsley, and continue to saute until spinach is limp, about 2 minutes. Remove
            from heat and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, feta, salt, and pepper. Add spinach mixture and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough in prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of
            phyllo dough on top, brush with olive oil, and repeat process with two more sheets of phyllo. The sheets
            will
            overlap the pan. Spread spinach and cheese mixture into pan and fold overhanging dough over filling. Brush
            with oil, then layer remaining 4 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with oil. Tuck overhanging dough into
            pan to seal filling.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until phyllo is golden brown. Cut into squares and serve while
            hot.</li>
    </ol>
