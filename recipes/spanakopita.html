                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                <li>1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
                <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x9-inch square baking pan.</li>
                <li>Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic until soft and
                    lightly browned. Stir in spinach and parsley, and continue to sauté until spinach is limp, about 2
                    minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, feta, salt, and pepper. Add spinach mixture and stir to
                    combine.</li>
                <li>Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough in prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another
                    sheet of phyllo dough on top, brush with olive oil, and repeat the process with two more sheets of
                    phyllo. The sheets will overlap the pan. Spread spinach and cheese mixture into pan and fold
                    overhanging dough over filling. Brush with oil, then layer remaining 4 sheets of phyllo dough,
                    brushing each with oil. Tuck overhanging dough into the pan to seal filling.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until phyllo is golden brown. Cut into squares and
                    serve while hot.</li>
            </ol>
